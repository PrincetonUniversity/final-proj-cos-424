TASKS FOR EVERYONE:
1. Make sure you have a folder named just by your netid
2. clone the repo inside of that folder (https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/final-proj-cos-424)

NOTES FOR EVERYUONE
1. when you cd inside to the cyc424 in cycles, run source py/bin/activate to get a python3 env with sklearn.
2. make sure to use tmux to keep your computations alive
3. make changes only in the cloned repo in your personal folder so you don't interfere with others' stuff, then push it when it's ready. Don't push broken code.

TODOs:

1. Type up project goal
2. Do Step (0) from the previous email (that involves retrieving and parsing the data in the same way as assignment 2).
3. Do Steps (1) and (2) from the previous email.  This involves setting up an ipython notebook in the repo, and retrieving the original 33-chromosome data.
